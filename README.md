## Introduction
Hi, I'm Fearne ðŸ‘‹ 

Thank you for taking a look through the repository as well as the hosted version on [Netlify](https://fearnes-decision-maker.netlify.app).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I decided to use Create React App for a few reasons, mainly because it is quick and easy to set up, familiar, and works pretty well out of the box for deployments with Netlify.

Another thing I utilised was an example of using React Flow with Create React App, as a template so I could build on top of it quickly. Link [here](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow-example-apps/tree/main/reactflow-create-react-app).

## Limitations
As previously mentioned, I used Create React App as a way to bootstrap this project. unfortunately this method of bootstrapping a project is quite bloated. If this was a longer term project, I would consider other options like Next.js, if the product requirements matched up with any additional features.

With it being an MVP version of a decision maker, I chose to forgoe testing in favour of exploring two libraries that I'd never used before (React Flow & Zustand). If this was production code I would build tests around the code as I go. 

As a bigger project I would lean into better compartmentalisation of components and/or using a component library. 

## Local Setup
Please find below the versioning I have used so you can make sure everything runs okay!\
`node: v20.3.0`\
`npm: v9.6.7`\
`nvm: v0.39.1`


## Scripts
I went with npm as my packages manager so run the follwing to install packages, build and start the project locally.\

In the repo directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

Installs required packages.

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
